    "The purpose of this notebook is to give a preliminary performance analysis on the controls systems.  For this notebook, a single value will be looked at to deterimine the performance of the control, which will be the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) at a specific setpoint for 120 seconds of continuous data.  This could be expanded upon by doing this analysis for multiple setpoints and averaging the RSME values together.  The RSME was chosen because it converts the metric back into the same units as the output being evaluated and that provides a more intuitive interpretation of the value."
